## 1. Social Bios (The "Orchestrator" Identity)

### LinkedIn Headline
**Founder & Orchestrator @ Gaari | Architecting Intelligent Futures | Scaling Ventures to 1M+ Data Points | Full-Stack Strategist (Next.js, AI)**

### LinkedIn About (Summary)
**The Greatest Team You'll Ever Lead Is The One Inside Your Screen.**

I don't just find leads; I create markets.
I don't just manage teams; I architect swarms.

I am a Venture Architect and Systems Orchestrator who operates at the intersection of high-level strategy and low-level execution ("Founder Mode"). From pivoting a poultry farm at 16 to architecting the **Gaari** mobility ecosystem (handling 1M+ data points), my career has been defined by one principle: **Systematic Venture Building**.

**What I Do:**
*   **Orchestration**: Leading 200+ member teams (NSUSS) and automated AI agents simultaneously.
*   **Architecture**: Building scalable, production-grade platforms using Next.js, Supabase, and RAG pipelines.
*   **Strategy**: deploying the "4-Layer SEO Framework" to dominate search results.

I am not a theorist. I am a builder who strategizes.
