# LinkedIn Launch Announcement Drafts

Here are three variations for your LinkedIn post. Choose the one that best fits your current mood and brand voice.

---

## Option 1: The Visionary Founder (Bold & Impactful)
*Focuses on the "Digital HQ" and "Founder's Logic" aspect.*

**Headline:** The new Digital HQ is live. 🚀

I’ve spent the last few weeks not just building a portfolio, but architecting a space that truly represents how I think and build.

Today, I’m officially launching **[https://portfolio-rizwanul.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-rizwanul.vercel.app/)**.

It’s more than a showcase of my work with **Gaari** and **The Trail**; it’s a deep dive into my philosophy as a Digital Strategist and Full-Stack Developer. I wanted a platform that feels alive, premium, and relentlessly focused on the truth of what we build.

**What you’ll find:**
✨ A breakdown of my core projects.
🧠 "Founder's Logic" – insights into my strategic process.
🛠️ The tech stack behind my scalable systems (Next.js, TypeScript, AI/ML).

This isn't just a static site. It's the beginning of a conversation.

Check it out and let me know—what does your Digital HQ say about you?

## Option 2: The Technical Architect (Detail-Oriented)
*Highlights the tech stack and the "Evolved Minimalism" design.*

**Headline:** Redefining my digital presence. 💻

I’m excited to share my newly redesigned portfolio: **[https://portfolio-rizwanul.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-rizwanul.vercel.app/)**.

The goal was simple: **Evolved Minimalism**. I wanted high performance, zero clutter, and a design that gets out of the way of the content.

**Under the hood:**
*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a custom design system
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL & Supabase
*   **Performance:** Optimized with dynamic imports and edge caching

It’s live on Vercel now. I’d love to hear your feedback on the UX and performance.

## Option 3: The Humble Creator (Personal & Story-Driven)
*Focuses on the journey and the value of sharing work.*

**Headline:** It’s time to share what I’ve been working on. 👋

For a long time, I’ve been heads-down building **Gaari**, **The Trail**, and helping businesses scale with digital strategies. But I realized I needed a central place to bring all these stories together.

So, I built this: **[https://portfolio-rizwanul.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-rizwanul.vercel.app/)**

It’s a collection of my case studies, my technical writing, and my journey so far. It’s still day one, and I have a lot more to add (including a new series on AI integration), but I’m proud to ship it today.

If you’re hiring, collaborating, or just looking for inspiration, take a look.

Thanks for the support!
