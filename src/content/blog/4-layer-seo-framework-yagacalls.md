---# 4-Layer SEO Framework: How I Optimized Yagacalls

When I took on the lead developer role at Yagacalls, a platform serving 3,500+ investors with trading calls and market analysis, SEO wasn't just important—it was critical for growth. I developed a 4-layer SEO framework that transformed our organic visibility.

- Platform-specific searches

Traditional SEO wasn't enough. We needed a comprehensive approach.
