        question: "Why is your effective rate ($10/hr) significantly lower than the $20/hr market average?",
        answer: "It's about efficiency, not cheap labor. I leverage advanced AI-augmented workflows and a library of pre-built proprietary modules to build 2x faster than traditional developers. You aren't paying for me to reinvent the wheel; you're paying for rapid, architectural assembly. The result? Twice the output in half the billable hours.",

    {
        question: "I have a vague idea but no technical plan. Can you help?",
        answer: "That is my specialty. My headline, \"Your Vision Is Chaos. I Architect It Into Profit,\" isn't just a slogan. I specialize in taking raw, unstructured ideas and converting them into concrete technical roadmaps, database schemas, and profitable products. We start with a strategy session, not code.",

        question: "Do you handle the entire stack, including Design and DevOps?",
        answer: "Yes. I am a Full-Stack Systems Architect. I handle everything from the initial UI/UX design (using modern tools like Figma and Shadcn/UI) to the Backend logic (Next.js/Supabase) and final DevOps deployment (Docker/VPS). You get a complete, production-ready vertical.",

        question: "What happens after the project is launched?",
        answer: "Systems need stewardship. I offer retainer packages for ongoing maintenance, feature updates, and scaling support. As your 'Fractional CTO', I ensure your platform evolves with your business growth.",

    },
    {
        question: "How do you ensure the code is scalable?",
        answer: "I don't build 'MVP hack-jobs'. I build scalable foundations using industry-standard architecture (Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL). My code is cleaner, modular, and documented, meaning your future team can pick it up without a complete rewrite.",
